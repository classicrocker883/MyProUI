            Thanks for your contribution!

            Unfortunately, we can only accept **PR**s targeting the **default** branch.

            Anything Marlin specific, or `HC32-*` branches should be submitted [here](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/new/choose).

            To fix this:
              1. Rebase your branch onto `default`.
              2. Submit a new **PR** targeting the most recent.

            Please redo this **PR** starting with the most recent branch and be careful to target it when resubmitting the **PR**.

            See [this page](https://marlinfw.org/docs/development/getting_started_pull_requests.html) for full instructions.
