## Universal Firmware for RET6/RCT6 chips: G32, N32, H32, Creality 4.2.7 and 4.2.2 boards
**_<sup>(Also available for BTT SKR Mini E3 and others)</sup>_**

### - Please read this: -
> [!NOTE]
Many Updates have been included in the most recent MRiscoCProUI for the **2025-January** release.
This release has many changes to the **UI**.
New ICON's have been added, and old ones enhanced. Whoever edited them before saved directly as .*JPG* which in many editors lowers the quality of the image. I painstakingly remastered almost every single one; preserving the original quality.
>
> > You must [REFLASH](https://github.com/classicrocker883/MRiscoCProUI/wiki/HOW-TO-UPDATE-THE-DISPLAY) the *LCD Display* with the new **DWIN_SET**; which is located in the `display assets` folder.
>
> If you encounter any issues, suggestions, or feature requests please feel free to post it on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/classicrocker883/MRiscoCProUI/issues), otherwise if everything is going well please leave a comment.
>
> I will be working on more upgrades and features and tweaks along the way. Enjoy using this fork of Marlin as I intend it to be the best; easy to use and convenient. So far I really enjoy the new settings and toolbar for the main menu. There is a variety of parameters and options that can be changed without having to reflash the firmware - like with other versions.
>
> If you start printing and it says `Advance Pause` while **Runout** is enabled, you may have to change state it triggers no filament to **HIGH**, or **LOW** (depending on what is already selected). This is found in the _Prepare_ menu/ _Filament Management_/ _Filament Settings_ -> _Runout Active_.

<br>

#### Important Info regarding HC32:
> [!WARNING]
>
> <ins>**FOREWARNING**</ins>: So far everything has been working great - as normal - except there is an issue with the initialization of the SD card media. If you get a message saying this has failed, just reinsert the card or reboot. Keep trying if this doesn't work the first time. Also using Gcode Thumbnail Preview is giving issues with freezing so this has been disabled for now.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> The screen may **freeze and restart** when the SD card is inserted. This means that everything *so far* seems to work correctly as it should, except for when an **SD card is inserted**, so printing may not be possible *unless* you use USB serial interface to upload the file (through a slicer or something like Pronterface).

> [!TIP]
> H32->HC32 support is currently only in the branch **HC32-&lt;Month&gt;**. You can find the original repo here [@shadow578/Marlin-H32](https://github.com/shadow578/Marlin-H32)
>
> HC32 support has recently been added to the [Marlin Firmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) repository. Please post any [Issues](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues) there first, otherwise if there are any ProUI specific issues or anything else to report please do so under [Issues tab](https://github.com/classicrocker883/MRiscoCProUI/issues) here.

### MarlinSimulator.exe Instructions

There is a *MarlinSimulator.exe* file provided to test out for yourself. It simulates a pre-built configuration of this firmware.

To create your own MarlinSimulator with your own build, start by changing in Configuration.h **MOTHERBOARD** to *BOARD_SIMULATED*, also disable `ENDSTOP_INTERRUPTS_FEATURE` and `PROUI_EX`, and then in platformio.ini **default_envs =** change to *simulator_windows*. The MarlinSimulator can only compile for Manual Mesh Bed Leveling for now, so make sure your configuration is set for `MESH_BED_LEVELING`.

Then you have to extract **SDL2-devel-2.30.5-mingw.zip** from /**docs**.
You can either copy/paste the files directly, or install them.

32-bit files are in \i686-w64-mingw32
64-bit files are in \x86_64-w64-mingw32
Navigate to the SDL2 directory in an *MSYS2 MINGW64* terminal (Run as Administrator):

To install SDL for native (32-bit) development:
>     make native

To install SDL for cross-compiling development:
>     make cross

Recommended for 64-bit - If you receive an error, then try the following:
>     make install-package arch=x86_64-w64-mingw32 prefix=/usr

You may have to first Build so the directory can be created, but you can:
**Copy** the contents of ~\SDL2-2.30.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2\\* into the directory ~\.pio\libdeps\simulator_windows\\**imgui**
-OR-
**Copy** the just folder ~\SDL2-2.30.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\\**SDL2** into the directory ~\.pio\libdeps\\*simulator_windows*

Once all that is done, just Build like you would normally and *MarlinSimulator.exe* will be created.

For MacOS or Linux, you're on your own...sorry.

This work would not be possible without me spending time working on it for free.

I would greatly appreciate supporters, helpers, and betatesters whenever possible.

Please show your support by considering making a donation, or giving your input if you end up using this firmware.

It wasn't easy getting it to this point. I am just a basic programmer and the work is mostly trial and error. Thank goodness for VS Code's compiler and also AI like ChatGPT which shows me what changes need to be made as I make them.

Marlin firmware is an Open Source project hosted on Github, [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/) is owned and maintained by the maker community.

VS Code is an IDE program owned and maintained by Microsoft.
